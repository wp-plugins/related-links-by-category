This is a widget for the sidebar that shows other posts in the same category as the post being viewed.

== Description ==

There are several plugins that add a widget to the sidebar showing recent posts from a chosen category. But this plugin choses the category automatically based on the category that the post being viewed belongs to. The widget only displays on single post pages.

== Installation ==

= First time installation instructions =

   1. Unzip and upload the php file to your wordpress plugin directory
   2. Activate the plugin
   3. Go to the Design > Widgets - Drag the widget into a sidebar and save!
   
= Configuration =

The title of the widget and number of posts for each category can be changed through the menu on the 'Widgets' page.

== Changelog ==

Update 1.1: Fixed link structure so the link doesn't rely on the post's GUID
